# spool
A `repo` made for dumping all the notes or information on subjects for IOE preparation of Nepal.

## *note*
- Please keep all the required `.md` files in `/<category>` folder. This is to support github pages just my thought :)
- `/res-common` contains images that are common to all categories.
- `/docs/<category>/res` contains the images/resource files required for that category.
- better use `LaTeX` in math equations.
