# spool
A `repo` made for dumping all the notes or information on subjects for IOE preparation of Nepal.

## *note*
- Please keep all the required `.md` files in `/docs/<category>` folder. This is to support github pages just my thought :)
- `/docs/img` contains images that are common to all categories.
- `/docs/<category>/img` contains the images required for that category.
- better use `LaTeX` in math equations.
