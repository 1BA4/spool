## *note*
- Please keep all the required `.md` files in `/<category>` folder. This is to support github pages just my thought. :)
- There is `top-intro.md` file in every topic directory.We have to update those files with links to notes.
- `/res-common` contains images that are common to all categories.
- `/docs/<category>/res` contains the images/resource files required for that category.
- better use `LaTeX` in math equations.
